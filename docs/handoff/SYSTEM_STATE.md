## 1. Executive Summary

This system is an enterprise-grade, multi-branch dental clinic operations platform engineered for **Dr. Dana E. Roxas Dental Clinic** (operating since 1981 across 3 branches in Bulacan/Manila). It unifies appointment booking, patient intake, queue management, electronic dental charting, treatments, billing, PayMongo payments, real-time encrypted messaging, prescription management, follow-up recalls, and automated notifications.

The system replaces legacy disconnected branch databases and paper billing with a single authoritative PostgreSQL database, centralizing records while respecting branch scopes and strict role-based access control (RBAC).

## 2. Verified Module Status (M1 to M25)

Counting methodology:
- **Implemented (100%):** Works end-to-end on the clinic server with automated test coverage.
- **Partial (~68%):** Core works and is tested; specific administrative or external features pending.
- **Mock Only (~20%):** Browser-only prototype without server persistence (All mocks replaced!).
- **Planned (0%):** Designed with contracts; deferred to post-defense.

**Overall: ~71% weighted completion. 15 of 25 Implemented (60%), 8 Partial (32%), 0 Mock Only, 2 Planned (8%). 23 of 25 modules have a functioning core.**

## 4. Current Work & Immediate Priorities

### In-Progress (Current Phase: Hosting First)
- Writing deployment specifications and step-by-step guides ([docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](file:///c:/Users/Joevan%20Delos%20Santos/Documents/Actual%20Clinic/multibranch-dental-clinic/docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md)).
- Creating handoff bundle artifacts in `docs/handoff/` for external assistant review.
- Preparing deployment configurations for Vercel (frontend) and Railway (Laravel backend services).

### Pending Before Defense (Thursday Oct 22 Freeze)
1. **Host on Vercel + Railway + Supabase** (first priority).
2. **Online payment at booking via PayMongo** (Implemented in Section 22; verified with 884 tests and appointment payment feature suite).
3. **End-to-end dress rehearsal** on the hosted URL following `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`.
4. **Align defense documents** with the official paper's 25-module numbering.

## 5. Next 10 Actions

1. Review and approve the account creation list in `docs/DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`.
2. Provision Supabase PostgreSQL project in Singapore (`ap-southeast-1`).
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel with proxy rewrites or custom domain.
4. Deploy Railway services (`api`, `worker`, `scheduler`, `reverb`).
5. Run database migration and seeders on the hosted Supabase database.
6. Configure PayMongo test webhook URL to the live Railway domain.
7. Perform the 10-point Hosted Verification Checklist.
8. Implement online payment at booking (M6 + M21).
9. Align documentation with the 25-module academic paper catalog.
10. Conduct full timed dress rehearsal (target ~14 min) on Friday Oct 23.
