## Working Agreement

<working_agreement>
  <source_of_truth>Each member updates status ONLY in their own slice file (QA-<NAME>.md). This master file is the reference; the lead syncs the Progress Summary at the end of each day. This avoids merge conflicts in one shared file.</source_of_truth>
  <shared_component_owners>
    Design tokens, style guide, calendar: Richmon
    Dropdown, buttons, dental chart: Yzhekiel
    Search input, X-clear filter, notif button, refresh icon, notifications UI: Celin
    Soft delete + archive RBAC service, approval automation: Jaztin
    Live queue model, branch scoping, notification/search/chart endpoints: Joevan
    Rule: do not edit a component you do not own. Log the request in the Blockers table instead.
  </shared_component_owners>
  <git>
    Branch: qa/<member>-<batch-id> (example: qa/jaztin-JAZ-1)
    One commit per revision ID, message: [ID] short title
    PR per batch; title: [BATCH] name; description lists IDs and acceptance results
    Foundation PRs (Day 1) are merged first; everyone rebases before starting Day 2
  </git>
  <cadence>
    15-minute sync at the start of each day: yesterday done, today plan, blockers.
    Feature freeze at end of Day 5. Days 6 and 7 are fixes and regression only.
    Any item not done by end of Day 5 is escalated to the lead at the Day 6 sync.
  </cadence>
</working_agreement>

## 5. Instructions for Claude

<claude_instructions>
  1. Work only on the member and batch the user names. Read the whole batch first.
  2. Check `depends_on`. Build shared components once and reuse them across dashboards.
  3. Fix items in order. Stay within each item's scope and say so when you touch anything else.
  4. Satisfy every acceptance line before marking an item done. Flag anything unclear instead of guessing.
  5. UI standards: responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop), all states (hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error), keyboard accessible, consistent with the shared design tokens.
  6. Backend standards: server-side validation, RBAC on every protected action, explicit error handling, no duplicate submissions, soft-delete only (see GEN-11), no secrets in logs.
  7. After the batch, run the batch verification and summarize changes per ID.
  8. Clarification protocol: if an item has `needs_clarification`, an unapproved `proposed_design`, or you lack a required file, stop and ask before coding. Never invent file paths, endpoints, or field names; find them in the attached code or ask.
  9. Keep changes small: one revision ID per commit, message `[ID] short title`. Do not edit components owned by another member (see Working Agreement); describe the needed change instead.
  10. Report format per ID: files changed, summary, how to test, acceptance results (pass/fail), and anything not done.
  11. Respect the schedule: do the ID order in the 7-day plan; flag any item that cannot finish that day.
</claude_instructions>

<global_dependencies>
  GEN-11 (archive + RBAC) must land before any delete UI is changed (STF-25, DEN-16, GEN-10 delete button).
  GEN-08 (design tokens) should land first so other UI work uses shared styles.
  GEN-14 (calendar component) feeds STF-01, OWN-07, OWN-08, OWN-09.
  STF-14/15 (queue model) must land before STF-16/17 and OWN-13.
  GEN-01 (approval automation) feeds STF-06, STF-11, DEN-15.
</global_dependencies>

## Definition of Done

<definition_of_done>
  A revision is `done` only when ALL are true:
  - [ ] Every task checkbox is ticked and every acceptance line passes
  - [ ] Works on Staff, Dentist, and Owner dashboards where the item applies ("same as" items reuse the shared component)
  - [ ] UI items: checked at mobile, tablet, desktop; all states present (hover, focus, disabled, loading, error); uses design tokens
  - [ ] Backend items: server-side validation, RBAC enforced, errors handled, tests added, no hard delete, no secrets in logs
  - [ ] No new console errors; build, lint, and tests pass
  - [ ] PR reviewed by one other member
  - [ ] Status set to done in the owner's slice file
</definition_of_done>

    <note>2026-10-29 B1: Playwright MCP against the real local Laravel API and verified dental_clinic_scratch rendered Join (adult guardian plus minor dependent), signed-in Patient Family, and Staff CounterIntake. Other detail stayed controlled while typed; switching to a standard choice hid and cleared it; switching back started blank; whitespace-only detail disabled submission. Join POST sent Other/Niece and preserved guardian identity; Staff review showed the minor, guardian, and Other (Niece). Staff confirmed with Other ID/Company Health Card, and GET patient record returned that ID detail and unchanged guardian name. Family POST returned Other/Nephew; page reload showed the saved relationship. IntakeTest includes server-side blank rejection, standard-ID stale-detail clearing, minor/guardian rules, and role/branch restrictions. Added an API regression for the intake Other relationship after Staff confirmation. Clinical.jsx's older NewPatientModal is a browser-only path and is not rendered in the supported server session; Staff registration uses the server-backed form without a Sex Other choice. The active Join self Sex field has no Other option. No production defect was reproduced.</note>

## GEN-09 prescription-flow baseline (support evidence, 2026-10-29)

GEN-09 is owned by Richmon in `FINALS-QA-REVISIONS.md`; this note does not change its status. Source-derived path: a Dentist opens Prescriptions from role navigation, selects a recent visit, reviews the allergy notice, enters prescription lines, chooses Issue prescription, confirms the locking action, and the issued record opens automatically (`src/data.js`, `src/layout.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/pages/ServerPrescriptions.jsx`). Save draft is optional: the Issue path creates or updates the draft before issuing it. No runtime user actions were counted; the page loads server-backed visits and prescriptions, and no verified database-free runtime was available under this batch's restrictions.

Potential navigation repetition, not a measured saving: Treatment already resolves the exact visit ID (`src/pages/Clinical.jsx`), while ordinary navigation clears page context and the Prescriptions page receives none (`src/layout.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`). A later shortcut could carry that encounter context and preselect only a matching server-authorized visit; the Dentist must still review allergies, choose medicines and instructions, and confirm issue. The existing `tests/m19-prescriptions.test.js` checks source structure, not this interaction. The earlier source-level concern about Other selection is resolved by the rendered acceptance below.

## B1 rendered and API acceptance (2026-10-29)

- **GEN-09 custom-value acceptance: completed for the assigned prescription behavior.** In Playwright MCP, the signed-in Dentist opened Prescriptions, selected a server-listed recent visit, chose a predefined medicine, switched to Other, typed a fictional custom medicine, switched to another predefined medicine, and returned to Other. The field hid on the predefined choice and returned blank, then retained the newly typed custom value. Blank Other disabled Save draft. Custom dosage, frequency, and duration also stayed selected while edited. The POST contained only the five clinical line fields. A 201 response saved the draft; after page reload, Edit draft restored all four Other selections and their saved values. A PUT changed dosage only; the reopened dialog showed the edited dosage and unchanged medicine, frequency, duration, and instructions, and an authenticated GET returned 200. The prescription remained Draft; no issued record was altered. New PrescriptionTest coverage repeats create/GET/edit/GET with exact field assertions on the scratch database. Existing PrescriptionTest checks Dentist and branch authority, patient and Owner visibility, and issued-record locking. No production defect was reproduced.
- **QA scope distinction:** `FINALS-QA-REVISIONS.md` defines GEN-09 as Richmon's broader click-reduction task. This B1 evidence completes the custom-value acceptance requested by the coordinator; it does not establish fewer clicks for check-in, appointments, patient records, or prescriptions. The master tracker needs a separate owner-led click audit before its GEN-09 item can be marked done.
- **Verification:** `node --test tests/gen07-*.test.js tests/intake.test.js tests/m19-prescriptions.test.js` 24/24; focused scratch-guarded IntakeTest and PrescriptionTest 27/27, 674 assertions; full frontend suite 954/954 outside the sandbox; `npm run test:smoke` passed with existing React key warnings; `npm run build` passed with the existing chunk-size warning. The first sandboxed full frontend run failed in 10 subprocess-backed files; rerun outside the sandbox passed. Browser tests used the existing idempotent fictional seeders on `dental_clinic_scratch` only. `scripts/predefense-check.sh` was not run because it targets the separate demo environment rather than the authorized scratch database.
