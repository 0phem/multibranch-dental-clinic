// Server-first M6/M8/M9/M5 command flows. Every appointment, Visit, queue and Treatment change is a Laravel command
// followed by a refresh of the in-memory server projection; the browser-local adapter step for unfinished modules
// (follow-ups, billing, prescriptions, HMO, in-app notifications) runs only after the server succeeded and is never used
// to reverse it. Arrival (Check-In / Walk-In) is entirely server-side since M9, and treatment since M5.
//
// Dependencies are injected so the exact flow the store uses is unit-testable with a mocked API:
//   getState()/getSession()  latest store snapshot and session
//   getActions()             the committed workflow actions (adapters)
//   refresh()                reloads the server appointment/Visit/queue/Treatment projection (async)
//   api / visits / queue / treatments   appointments-api.js / visits-api.js / queue-api.js / treatments-api.js (or doubles)
