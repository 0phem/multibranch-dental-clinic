/**
 * Knowledge mode of the Clinic Assistant (no AI, nothing leaves the clinic server). It answers only from:
 *   - live clinic records: services, branches (names, addresses, hours, closed days), accepted payment methods, the clinic's
 *     contact settings, and — for the signed-in Patient only — their own appointments and balance (AssistantTools);
 *   - the clinic's editable answers (assistant_answers, Administration → Assistant answers).
 * A question below the confidence threshold gets "did you mean" suggestions; an unknown clinic question is handed to the front
 * desk (never invented); a question that is not about the clinic is politely redirected. Actions are buttons only.
